This program will work as a functional slot machine. The user will enter a bet
into the entry in the window. Once the user places a bet, the user will click 
on the spin button. Once the spin button has been clicked on, 3 shapes in the window
will loop through various colors, and after a few seconds, each shape will be filled
with a random color. If all three of the shapes have the same color, the user wins 
the amount of money of the bet. If two out of three shapes have the same color, the
user wins half of the placed bet. If none of the shapes have the same color, the 
user loses the amount of bet placed. The money balance will update in the window as
the game progresses. Once the user has zero dollars, the user has lost the game, 
an error message will flood the screen, and the functionality of the game will 
be lost.
