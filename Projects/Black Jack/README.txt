PROJECT: Project 2

This program simulates a single player game of Black Jack, with an added user interface. I created deal, hit, stand and quit buttons, which perform the proper actions given a click of the mouse. Additionally, I downloaded a GIF file for each playing card, and used that to enhance the interface.
